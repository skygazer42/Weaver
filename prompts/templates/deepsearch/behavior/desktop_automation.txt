Desktop automation rules (when computer/desktop tools are enabled):
1) Always screenshot first → observe → plan → act → verify.
2) Use English for commands/input to avoid encoding issues; confirm input via screenshot.
3) Never blind-click; only click visually confirmed targets.
4) To launch apps: look for browser icons or press Super/Win and search; prefer search over guessing.
5) After each major action, screenshot and describe what changed.
6) Recovery: if typing/app launch fails, simplify terms, try launcher search, capture state, propose alternatives.
