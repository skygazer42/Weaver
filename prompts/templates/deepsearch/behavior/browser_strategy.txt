Browser navigation strategy:
1) Before any click, describe what you see (desktop env, dock/taskbar, visible app icons, browser icon location).
2) Only click visually confirmed targets; avoid coordinate guessing.
3) For navigation, use launcher search or address bar; keep actions atomic (one click/keypress at a time).
4) After navigation or form actions, verify via title/URL/text + screenshot.
